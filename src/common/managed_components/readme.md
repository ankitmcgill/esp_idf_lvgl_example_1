Esp Lvgl Is A Esp-Resistry Component That Should Be Downloaded By Adding Dependency To The Project
Using A Yaml File
Https://Components.Espressif.Com/Components/Espressif/Esp_Lvgl_Port/Versions/2.6.2/Readme

When You Compile, The Compiler Reads This Yaml File And Automaticlly Downloads Esp-Lvgl-Port

I Took The Downloaded Folders "Espressif__Esp_Lvgl_Port" And "Lvgl__Lvgl" And Moved To The Common Src Folder So That All The Projects Can Use It
